Notes for the Microsoft Exam - MS:100

Hi all, this repository links to my Notes for the MS:100 exam by Microsoft.
"MS-100 Rendition One" is where I am taking all of my initial notes (It is a mess).
Once the notes have been taken here I reformat them and then create a cheat sheet that is applicable to the real world situation.

I have linked the OneDrive folder below. Feel free to use these cheat sheets as you see fit :)
